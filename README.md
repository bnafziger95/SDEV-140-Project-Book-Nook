# SDEV-140-Project-Book-Nook
Final project for SDEV 140
4/28/2025
Starting progress for the GUI program final project

Title for GUI Project: Book Nook

Goals:
To allow users to log books read along with details (title, author, genre, status, and rating)
To allow users to view books read in a stored JSON file.

Windows:
1. Main Window  2. Add Book Window  3. View Library Window

Completed so far to date:
Pseudocode the full plan for each file
Imported necessary libraries needed to program GUI and JSON for data storage
Created the windows and buttons for some windows
Started coding functions in utils file.

Next steps:
Continue coding functions and buttons in each window
Trial and error colors/format of windows
Add images to desired windows
Test with data input

Problems:
Mainly just figuring out the pathways
I need to figure out a plan to possibly allow user to edit status bar
Otherwise, I will cut the status function out completely and only have user enter completed books
